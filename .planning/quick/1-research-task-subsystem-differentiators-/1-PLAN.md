# Quick Task 1: Research Task Subsystem Differentiators

## Goal
Identify experiment dimensions that can actually discriminate between tool interface variants, given v1.1 showed 100% vs 100% (Fisher p=1.0).

## Deliverable
`DIFFERENTIATORS-RESEARCH.md` covering 10 dimensions, each with:
- Hypothesis, measurement method, experiment sketch
- Expected signal strength, implementation effort
- Prioritized top-3 roadmap for next milestone

## Key Files
- ADR: `docs/adr-tool-interface-experiment.md`
- Scenarios: `tests/experiment/scenarios.py`
- Variants: `tests/experiment/variants/`
- Task tools: `src/joi_agent_langgraph2/tasks/tools.py`

## Verification
- `DIFFERENTIATORS-RESEARCH.md` exists with 8+ dimensions, all grounded in v1.1 data
- STATE.md updated with quick task row
- Committed
