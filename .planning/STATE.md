## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.1: Simplified experiment-first approach — no automated evaluator redesign, manual review via LangSmith + Claude Code
- v1.1: See data before formalizing evaluators — JSONL capture + blind review, defer automated scoring to v1.2
- [Phase 07]: Matched eval_probe.py pattern for content extraction (proven approach)
- [Phase 07]: Wiped entire cache rather than attempting repair (corrupted data unreliable)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
