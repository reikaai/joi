# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Validated architectural decisions backed by evidence, not gut feel
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Codebase Alignment Audit

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Codebase Alignment Audit)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 1 complete — awaiting approval gate
Last activity: 2026-02-19 — Phase 1 audit completed

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 5min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Codebase Alignment Audit | 1 | 5min | 5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5min)
- Trend: baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 12 requirements. Audit first, then eval infra, then experiment, then ADR.
- Roadmap: Each phase has an approval gate — no automatic progression.
- Audit: Memory (Mem0) is highest-impact misalignment (score 8/10) -- needs architectural replacement in future milestone.
- Audit: Tasks subsystem confirmed as correct first experiment target for apps-vs-tools hypothesis.
- Audit: 3 subsystems (Graph Core, Context Management, Sandbox) have zero misalignments -- no action needed.

### Pending Todos

None yet.
