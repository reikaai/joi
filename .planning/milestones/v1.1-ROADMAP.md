# Roadmap Archive: v1.1 Eval Pipeline Rebuild & Re-validation

**Milestone Goal:** Get trustworthy experiment results so we can make defensible decisions about tool interfaces. Fix the 5 systemic bugs that invalidated v1.0 data, rebuild the experiment harness with proper isolation, run clean experiments, and make a decision grounded in real evidence.

**Shipped:** 2026-02-20

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 7: Infrastructure Fixes** — Fix serialization bug and invalidate corrupted cache so the measurement instrument works (completed 2026-02-20)
- [x] **Phase 8: Experiment Harness** — Build zero-persona isolated experiment mode with full capture, tool parity checks, clean scenarios, and fixed timestamps (completed 2026-02-20)
- [x] **Phase 9: Run Experiments** — Execute both tool variants against clean scenarios and collect JSONL for review (completed 2026-02-20)
- [x] **Phase 10: Review and ADR** — Review experiment data via LangSmith + Claude Code and produce ADR with defensible conclusions (completed 2026-02-20)

## Phase Details

### Phase 7: Infrastructure Fixes
**Goal**: The eval pipeline produces correct, complete data — full response text and tool calls are captured, and no corrupted cache entries contaminate results
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-02
**Plans**: 1 plan

- 07-01: Fix serialization bug and wipe corrupted v1.0 cache

### Phase 8: Experiment Harness
**Goal**: An isolated experiment mode exists that controls every variable except the one being tested (tool interface design), with full capture for post-hoc review
**Requirements**: EXPR-01, EXPR-02, EXPR-03, EXPR-04, CAPT-01, CAPT-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

- 08-01: Experiment infrastructure — simplified variants, JSONL capture, parity checks, v1.0 cleanup
- 08-02: Scenario design and parametrized experiment test with dual capture

### Phase 9: Run Experiments
**Goal**: Clean experiment data exists for both tool variants, collected with the fixed pipeline, ready for human review
**Requirements**: ANLS-01
**Plans**: 1 plan

- 09-01: Adapt harness for multi-run execution and run full experiment

### Phase 10: Review and ADR
**Goal**: A defensible decision on tool interface strategy, grounded in manually-verified experiment data
**Requirements**: ANLS-02, ANLS-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

- 10-01: Blind review of 120 transcripts, aggregate analysis, and ADR production
